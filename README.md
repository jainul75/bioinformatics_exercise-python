# Biology Meets Programming

This repository contains my Python solutions to the exercises from the
**"Biology Meets Programming: Bioinformatics for Beginners"**
course offered by **University of California San Diego (UCSD)** on Coursera.

## 🧬 What is Bioinformatics?

**Bioinformatics** is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology,
computer science, mathematics, and statistics to analyze and interpret
biological data. It plays a crucial role in modern life sciences, particularly
in areas such as:

- Genomics and genome sequencing
- Proteomics and Metabolomics analysis
- Precision medicine and variant interpretation

## 📚 Topics
- Python programming for bioinformatics
- Pattern matching and motif finding
- DNA sequence analysis
- k-mer frequency analysis
- Genome replication problems

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x
